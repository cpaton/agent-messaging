		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		This document is here to help in the understanding of the main aspects of the 
		source code provided as part of the dissertation and to enable you to build and 
		run the solution. It provides information on what packages the source depends 
		on in order for it to be compiled, the process of how to actually build the 
		solution and a description of how the source code is structured in order to 
		help you find your way around. <a name="Dependencies"></a>
		<h1>Dependencies</h1>
		The source code makes the use of three other packages that are required to be 
		installed on your system before the source code can be compiled. These packages 
		are GLib, SWIG and D-Bus all of which can be found in the <a href="dependencies">dependencies</a>
		directory on the disk as compressed&nbsp;source code tarballs which can be 
		installed using the standard ./configure and make cycle. If you have any 
		problems installing these packages then i will have to refer you to their 
		respective websites for more information, the addresses given&nbsp;are correct 
		as of May 2004:-
		<ul>
			<li>
				GLib - <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">http://www.gtk.org/</a>
			<li>
				D-Bus - <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/Software/dbus">http://www.freedesktop.org/Software/dbus</a>
			<li>
				SWIG - <a href="http://www.swig.org">http://www.swig.org</a></li>
		</ul>

		<h1>Building the Source Code</h1>
		<P>
			Before attempting to build the source code make sure that you have read the 
			section about the project <a href="#Dependencies">dependencies</a>. The 
			building process has only been tested on a Redhat Linux distribution but there 
			is no reason why it shouldn't work on other Linux versions. To make the proces 
			of compiling the source code easier a <a href="Build/makefile">make file</a> is 
			provided in the <a href="./build">build</a> directory. In order to use this 
			make file it requires the pkg-config tool to be installed and configured 
			correctly so that the header and library files for the the packages described 
			in the <a href="#Dependencies">dependencies</a> section can be found. If the 
			tool doesn't work then you will need to replace the pkg-config calls in the 
			CFLAGS and LIBS lines of the make file with the location of the library and 
			header files for D-Bus and GLib.&nbsp; Before the first time that you compile 
			the source code you will need to run</P>
		<P>make dirs</P>
		<P>to ensure that all the required directories are created and then after that just 
			call "make" to build the source.&nbsp; This will result in an executable called 
			Platform that can be run, see section <a href="#Runing">Running The Tests</a> to 
			find out how to use this program</P>
		<P>There is a seperate make file provided for the SWIG implementation that should 
			be used if you wish to make use of the API from a language other than C. The <a href="./SWIG/makefile">
				make file</a> builds a shared library and&nbsp;uses the inteface file to 
			build only Java bindings&nbsp;but other options could easily be added yourself. 
			In order to compile this section of the solution go to the <a href="./SWIG">SWIG</a>
			directory and just type "make" at a terminal, the platform code must have been 
			built prior to compiling the SWIG stuff. This make file has the same reliance 
			on the pkg-config tool as the make file described above, so similar measures 
			will have to be taken if pkg-config does not work on your system.</P>
		<h1>Running The Tests</h1>
		Before the platform or any of the tests are run the D-Bus session bus must be 
		started by using the dbus-daemon that would have been installed with the D-Bus 
		library. The following should be entered at a terminal to do this (assuming 
		that the dbus-daemon executable is contained within your path variable):<br>
		<br>
		dbus-daemon --session --fork --print-address<br>
		<br>
		The address that is printed to the terminal window <b>must</b> then be used to 
		set the environment variable DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS before the platform or 
		any of the tests are executed. This is required to ensure that the 
		platform/tests are able to connect to the session bus. To help automate this 
		process two scripts have been supplied in the <a href="./Build">build</a> directory 
		to do this for you.&nbsp; <a href="./Build/start-bus.sh">Start-bus.sh</a> starts 
		the D-Bus session bus and outputs the connection address to the screen, and 
		then <a href="./Build/set-env.sh">set-env.sh</a> can be used to set the 
		appropriate environment variables. Once this is complete either manually or by 
		using the scripts&nbsp;you can then run the solution by running the program 
		"Platform" from the <a href="./Build">build</a> directory. Without any 
		arguements this will bootstrap the agent platform and put it into a state where 
		it is ready to serve agents, its progress will be written to the terminal 
		window. The same program is used to run the tests that demonstrate the 
		platforms capabilities by passing it some command line arguements to instruct 
		it which test to perform, the possible arguements are given below. Each test 
		takes exactly either one or two arguements as specified. In order to run these 
		tests the platform must have been previously bootstrapped. It is recommended 
		that the platform be terminated and restarted between each test to avoid 
		interactions.

		<p>
			In order to run the SWIG tests a shared library must be built first using the <a href="./SWIG/makefile">
				make file</a> given in the <a href="./SWIG">SWIG</a> directory. The same 
			pre-requistite in that the DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS evironement variable must 
			be set before running any of the tests remains for running the Java agents. 
			Simialr to the C tests the Java tests require a command line parameter in order 
			to instruct it which test to run. In order to run these tests they should be 
			called from the SWIG/Java directory from a terminal as follows:
			<br>
			<br>
			[SWIG/Java]$ java -Djava.library.path=../ main {args}<br>
			<br>
		This is required so that the test program can find the shared library that 
		contains the platform code built by the makefile. The tests that the Java agent 
		is capable of running are given below

			<h1>Source Code Structure</h1>
		This section provides a brief overview of the structure of the source to 
		hopefully point in the right direction so that you can find what you are 
		looking for. Some of the key files will be briefly highlighted and explained, 
		as will the directory structure. All of the source and header files contain 
		header comments that provide more information about their purpose and each 
		function contains a comment denoting its use and what parameters must be given 
		to it and what if any value it returns. Therefore these files should be used to 
		get more detailed information.
